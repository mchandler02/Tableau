Longest Median Duration:

>The station with the longest median durations used as a starting station is 10Ave & W 202 St. The range of the top 10 
starting stations is from 26.8 to 34.8 minutes .
This could indicate that most starting station locations are used only for short trips for errands like getting lunch or 
stopping at the store.

>The station with the longest median durations used as an ending station is Hoboken Terminal-River St & Hudson Pl. The 
range of the top 10 ending stations is from 62.2 minutes to 27.8 hours.
This could indicate that those who use these end stations take the bikes for a full day's commute or to get locations after 
other methods of transportation may be unavailble.


Week Day Usage:

>The number of bike rentals markedly decreased in April 2020 compared to the previous and latter years. 
This is likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in fewer people traveling for work or pleasure.
There is not a strong pattern over the past three years of a certain day of the week in April that is going to result in 
more bike rentals, but in the past two years, Saturdays have been the most popular.

>Despite the number of bike rentals decreasing in April 2020, the trip duration increased that month compared to 2019 and 2021. 
This could be a result of people using the bikes as a safe outdoor leisure and excercise activity rather than as a commuting option.
Each year shows that Saturdays and Sundays are the days that have the longest trip duration. 
Again, this is likely a result of people using the bikes for leisure activities rather than commuting.
